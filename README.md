# VESA2  (Visualisation Enabled Search Application)

</p>

Repository for the Visualisation Enabled Search Application. It is a visual exploration and search tool that assists users in navigating through a knowledge graph in an intuitive way. Different visualisations assist in finding information across different dimensions. For example: Map &rarr; Spatial Context, Line Charts &rarr; Temporal context, Network Diagrams or graphs &rarr; interrelations, Word Cloud &rarr; Thematic context. Data is ingested from external sources into a local ArangoDB knowledge graph at setup time. All runtime queries run against the local graph — no live external calls.

## ✨ Features
You can find a list of the latest changes in the [CHANGELOG]()

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

That is the only requirement to run the full application stack.

> 💡 **For local development without Docker**
> You will additionally need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+ and a locally running ArangoDB instance on port 8529.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the application running:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/vesa2.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd vesa2
    ```

3. **Start the Application:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

Docker will build and start all three services in the correct order (ArangoDB → Backend → Frontend).

| Service  | URL                    |
|----------|------------------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000  |
| Backend  | http://localhost:5000  |
| ArangoDB | http://localhost:8529  |

ArangoDB credentials: `root` / `root`

> 💡 **TIP**
> To stop the application run `docker compose down`. To also remove the database volume run `docker compose down --volumes`.

## 🔌 Connecting a Data Source

On first run the database is empty. VESA2 ingests data through a local proxy API that fetches records from an external source and transforms them into the [VESA Data Adapter (`IDataAdapter`)](BACKEND/src/ingestion/contracts/IDataAdapter.ts) contract. The built-in proxies for PANGAEA and GBIF are ready-to-use examples and starting points for custom sources:

- [`BACKEND/src/proxy/pangaeaProxy.ts`](BACKEND/src/proxy/pangaeaProxy.ts)
- [`BACKEND/src/proxy/gbifProxy.ts`](BACKEND/src/proxy/gbifProxy.ts)

Once a proxy is running, use the **Setup** page in the frontend to ingest data:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 and navigate to **Setup**
2. Enter the proxy URL, a source prefix, batch size, and record limit
3. Click **Validate** — the system fetches one record to verify the [`IDataAdapter`](BACKEND/src/ingestion/contracts/IDataAdapter.ts) schema
4. Click **Start Sync** — data is ingested in batches into the local graph
5. Once complete, the main dashboard is populated and ready to explore

> 💡 **TIP**
> Any proxy that returns the [VESA Data Adapter (`IDataAdapter`)](BACKEND/src/ingestion/contracts/IDataAdapter.ts) schema integrates without any backend changes.

## 🏃 Running Without Docker (Local Development)

- **Run Backend:**

    ```bash
    cd BACKEND
    cp .env.template .env
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Before running, open the `.env` file and set `ARANGO_URL`, `ARANGO_DB_NAME`, `ARANGO_USER`, and `ARANGO_PASS`.

- **Run Frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd FRONTEND
    cp .env.template .env
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    Before running, open the `.env` file and set `VITE_API_URL` to point to your running backend.
